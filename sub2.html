					<h2>Isolation & Debut of "Typhoid Mary"</h2>
					<article>
						<p>Soper notified the New York City Health Department, whose investigators realized that Mallon was a typhoid carrier. Under sections 1169 and 1170 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Charter" title="New York City Charter">Greater New York Charter</a>, Mallon was arrested as a public health threat. She was forced into an ambulance by five policemen and Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Josephine_Baker" title="Sara Josephine Baker">Josephine Baker</a>, who at some point had to sit on Mallon to restrain her.
						</p>
						Mallon was transported to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Parker_Hospital" title="Willard Parker Hospital">Willard Parker Hospital</a>, where she was restrained and forced to give samples. For four days, she was not allowed to get up and use the bathroom on her own. The massive numbers of typhoid bacteria that were discovered in her stool samples indicated that the infection center was in her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder" title="Gallbladder">gallbladder</a>. Under questioning, Mallon admitted that she almost never washed her hands. This was not unusual at the time; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease" title="Germ theory of disease">germ theory of disease</a> still was not fully accepted.</a></p>
						<p>On March 19, 1907, Mallon was sentenced to quarantine on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_and_South_Brother_Islands_(New_York_City)" title="North and South Brother Islands (New York City)">North Brother Island</a>. While quarantined, she gave stool and urine samples three times per week. Authorities suggested removing her gallbladder, but she refused because she did not believe she carried the disease. At the time, gallbladder removal was dangerous, and people had died from the procedure. Mallon was also unwilling to stop working as a cook, a job that earned her more money than any other. Having no home of her own, she was always on the verge of poverty.
						</p>
						<p>After the publication of Soper's article in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, Mallon attracted extensive media attention and received the nickname "Typhoid Mary". Later, in a textbook that defined typhoid fever, she again was called "Typhoid Mary".
