					<h2>What happened?</h2>
					<article>
						<p>In August 1906, Mallon took a position in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_Bay_(hamlet),_New_York" title="Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York">Oyster Bay</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> with the family of a wealthy New York banker, Charles Henry Warren. Mallon went along with the Warrens when they rented a house in Oyster Bay for the summer of 1906. From August 27 to September 3, six of the 11 people in the family came down with typhoid fever. The disease at that time was "unusual" in Oyster Bay, according to three medical doctors who practiced there. The landlord, understanding that it would be impossible to rent a house with the reputation of typhoid, hired several independent experts to find the source of infection. They took water samples from pipes, faucets, toilets, and the cesspool, all of which were negative for typhoid.
						</p>
						<p>In late 1906, Mallon was hired by Walter Bowen, whose family lived on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Avenue" title="Park Avenue">Park Avenue</a>. Their maid fell sick on January 23 1907 and soon two of the household's servants had been hospitalised and the daughter of the house had contracted typhoid and died.

					<h2>Investigation</h2>
					<article>
						<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soper" title="George Soper">George Soper</a>, an investigator hired by the Oyster Bay property owner after the outbreak there, had been trying to determine the cause of typhoid outbreaks in well-to-do families, when it was known that the disease typically struck in unsanitary conditions. He discovered that a female Irish cook, who fitted the physical description he had been given, was involved in all of the outbreaks. He was unable to locate her because she generally left after an outbreak began, without giving a forwarding address. The Park Avenue outbreak helped to identify Mallon as the source of the infections. Soper learned of the case whilst it was still active and discovered Mallon was the cook.
						</p>
						<p>Soper first met Mallon in the kitchen of the Bowens' Park Avenue penthouse and accused her of spreading the disease. Though Soper himself recollected his behavior "as diplomatic as possible", he infuriated Mallon and she threatened him with a carving fork. When Mallon refused to give samples, Soper decided to compile a five-year history of her employment.
						</p>
						<p>He found that of the eight families that had hired Mallon as a cook, members of seven claimed to have contracted typhoid fever. Then Soper found out where Mallon's boyfriend lived and arranged a new meeting there. He took Dr. Raymond Hoobler in an attempt to persuade Mary to give them samples of urine and stool for analysis. Mallon again refused to cooperate, believing that typhoid was everywhere and that the outbreaks had happened because of contaminated food and water. At that time, the concept of healthy carriers was unknown even to healthcare workers.</p>
