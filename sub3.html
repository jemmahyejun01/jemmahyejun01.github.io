					<h2>Was it the Right Decision?</h2>
					<article>
						<p>Not all medical experts supported the decision to forcibly quarantine Mallon. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_J._Rosenau" title="Milton J. Rosenau">Milton J. Rosenau</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V._Chapin" title="Charles V. Chapin">Charles V. Chapin</a> both argued that she just had to be taught to carefully treat her condition and ensure that she would not transmit the typhoid to others. Both considered isolation to be an unnecessary, overly strict punishment. 
						</p> 
						<p>Mallon suffered from a nervous breakdown after her arrest and forcible transportation to the hospital. In 1909, she tried to sue the New York Health Department, but her complaint was denied and the case closed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court" title="New York Supreme Court">New York Supreme Court</a>. In a letter to her lawyer, she complained that she was treated like a "guinea pig". She was obliged to give samples for analysis three times a week, but for six months was not allowed to visit an eye doctor, even though her eyelid was paralyzed and she had to bandage it at night. Her medical treatment was hectic: she was given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urotropin" class="mw-redirect" title="Urotropin">urotropin</a> in three-month courses for a year, threatening to destroy her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney" title="Kidney">kidneys</a>. That was changed to brewer's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a> and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hexamethylenamin" class="extiw" title="wikt:hexamethylenamin">hexamethylenamin</a> in increasing doses.She was first told that she had typhoid in her intestinal tract, then in her bowel muscles, then in her gallbladder.

					<h2>Return</h2>
					<article>
						<p>Mallon herself never believed that she was a carrier. With the help of a friend, she sent several samples to an independent New York laboratory. All came back negative for typhoid. On North Brother Island, almost a quarter of her analyses from March 1907 through June 1909 were also negative. </p> 
						<p>After 2 years and 11 months of Mallon's quarantine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_H._Porter" title="Eugene H. Porter">Eugene H. Porter</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Commissioner_of_Health" class="mw-redirect" title="New York State Commissioner of Health">New York State Commissioner of Health</a>, decided that disease carriers should no longer be kept in isolation and that Mallon could be freed if she agreed to stop working as a cook and take reasonable steps to avoid transmitting typhoid to others. On February 19, 1910, Mallon said she was "prepared to change her occupation (that of a cook), and would give assurance by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit" title="Affidavit">affidavit</a> that she would upon her release take such hygienic precautions as would protect those with whom she came in contact, from infection." She was released from quarantine and returned to the mainland.
