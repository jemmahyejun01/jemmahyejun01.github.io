					<h2>Caught Again</h2>
					<article>
						<p>Upon her release, Mallon was given a job as a laundress, which paid less than cookingâ€”$20 per month instead of $50. At some point, she wounded her arm and the wound became infected, meaning that she could not work at all for six months. After several unsuccessful years, she started cooking again. She used fake surnames like Breshof or Brown, and took jobs as a cook against the explicit instructions of health authorities. No agencies that hired servants for upscale families would offer her employment, so for the next five years, she moved to the mass sector. She worked in a number of kitchens in restaurants, hotels, and spa centers. Almost everywhere she worked, there were outbreaks of typhoid.
						</p>
						<p>In 1915, Mallon started working at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Hospital_for_Women" title="Sloane Hospital for Women">Sloane Hospital for Women</a> in New York City. Soon 25 people were infected, and two died. The head obstetrician, Dr. Edward B. Cragin, called Soper and asked him to help in the investigation. Soper identified Mallon from the servants' verbal descriptions and also by her handwriting.
						</p>
						<p>Mallon again fled, but the police were able to find and arrest her when she took food to a friend on Long Island. Mallon was returned to quarantine on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_and_South_Brother_Islands_(New_York_City)" title="North and South Brother Islands (New York City)">North Brother Island</a> on March 27, 1915.</p>
						<p>Little is known about her life during the second quarantine. She remained on North Brother for more than 23 years, and the authorities gave her a private one-story cottage. As of 1918, she was allowed to take day trips to the mainland. In 1925, Dr. Alexandra Plavska came to the island for an internship. She organized a laboratory on the second floor of the chapel and offered Mallon a job as a technician. Mallon washed bottles, did recordings, and prepared glasses for pathologists.</p>

					<h2>Death</h2>
					<article>
						<p>Mallon spent the rest of her life in quarantine at Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island. Mallon was quite active until suffering a stroke in 1932; afterwards, she was confined to the hospital. She never completely recovered, and half of her body remained paralyzed. On November 11, 1938, she died of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> at age 69. Mallon's body was cremated, and her ashes were buried at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Raymond%27s_Cemetery" class="mw-redirect" title="Saint Raymond's Cemetery">Saint Raymond's Cemetery</a> in the Bronx. Nine people attended the funeral.</p>
